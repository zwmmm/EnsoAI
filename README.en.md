## Workflow, Reimagined.

Stop stashing and popping. EnsoAI treats every branch as a first-class workspace with its own dedicated AI context.

## FAQ

### Basic Usage

<details>
<summary><strong>How is EnsoAI different from a regular IDE?</strong></summary>

EnsoAI focuses on **Git Worktree + AI Agent** collaboration. It's not meant to replace VS Code or Cursor, but rather serves as a lightweight workspace manager that allows you to:
- Quickly switch between multiple worktrees, each running an independent AI Agent
- Develop multiple feature branches simultaneously without interference
- Jump to your preferred IDE anytime via "Open In" for deeper development

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Which AI Agents are supported?</strong></summary>

Built-in support for Claude, Codex, Gemini, Cursor Agent, Droid, and Auggie. You can also add any CLI-based agent in settings by specifying the launch command.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Are Agent sessions preserved?</strong></summary>

Yes. Each worktree's Agent session is saved independently. When you switch back to a worktree, the previous conversation context is still there.

</details>

---

### Use Cases

<details>
<summary><strong>When should I use EnsoAI?</strong></summary>

| Scenario | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Parallel Development** | Work on feature-A and bugfix-B simultaneously, each branch has independent AI sessions and terminals |
| **AI-Assisted Code Review** | Let AI review code in a new worktree without affecting main branch development |
| **Experimental Development** | Create a temporary worktree for AI to experiment freely, delete if unsatisfied |
| **Comparison Debugging** | Open multiple worktrees side by side to compare different implementations |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why use official CLIs instead of ACP?</strong></summary>

While ACP can unify core capabilities across different Agents, it's limited to just those core features and lacks many functionalities. Switching between different Agents isn't a common scenario, and the core features of different Agent CLIs are quite similar. We believe that for experienced developers, the native CLIs are more productive.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What project size is EnsoAI suitable for?</strong></summary>

Best suited for small to medium projects. For large monorepos, we recommend using it alongside VS Code or similar full-featured IDEs — EnsoAI handles worktree management and AI interaction, while the IDE handles deep development.

</details>

---

### Development Workflow

<details>
<summary><strong>What's a typical development workflow with EnsoAI?</strong></summary>

```
1. Open Workspace
   └── Select or add a Git repository

2. Create/Switch Worktree
   └── Create a worktree for new feature (auto-creates branch)

3. Start AI Agent
   └── Chat with Claude/Codex in the Agent panel
   └── AI works directly in the current worktree directory

4. Edit & Test
   └── Quick edits with built-in editor
   └── Run tests/builds in terminal

5. Commit & Merge
   └── Git commit/push in terminal
   └── Or use "Open In" to jump to IDE for final review
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How to efficiently manage multiple parallel tasks?</strong></summary>

1. Create a separate worktree for each task (`Cmd+N` or click + button)
2. Use `Cmd+1-9` to quickly switch between worktrees
3. Each worktree has independent Agent sessions, terminal tabs, and editor state
4. Delete worktree when done, optionally delete the branch too

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How to review AI-generated code?</strong></summary>

Recommended workflow:
1. Let AI generate code in a separate worktree
2. Review using built-in editor or "Open In Cursor/VS Code"
3. Commit in terminal if satisfied; continue the conversation or delete the worktree if not

</details>

---

### Keyboard Shortcuts

<details>
<summary><strong>What are the common keyboard shortcuts?</strong></summary>

| Shortcut | Function |
|----------|----------|
| `Cmd+Shift+P` | Open command palette |
| `Cmd+,` | Open settings |
| `Cmd+1-9` | Switch to corresponding tab |
| `Cmd+T` | New terminal/Agent session |
| `Cmd+W` | Close current terminal/session |
| `Cmd+S` | Save file |
| `Shift+Enter` | Insert newline in terminal |

</details>

---

### Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Agent won't start?</strong></summary>

1. Verify the CLI tool is installed (e.g., `claude`, `codex`)
2. Manually run the command in terminal to verify
3. Check Agent path configuration in settings

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Terminal display issues/artifacts?</strong></summary>

Go to Settings → Terminal → Switch renderer from WebGL to DOM.
